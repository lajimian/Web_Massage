            <div class="main-ctn-ans">Mobile Massages currently offers deep tissue, Swedish, sports, and prenatal massage.  Any  of  these modalities can be performed as a couples massage, either with two massage therapists  performing simultaneous massage or one therapists performing massage one after another.Soothe also offers chair and table massage delivered to your office or event with Mobile Massages at Work and Mabila Massages Events.</div>

            <div class="main-ctn-ans">We will match you with the highest quality massage therapist available at the time specified. You have the option to choose a mate or female therapist if you have a preference, but are not able to select the exact therapist that you'd like.</div>

        <div class="main-ctn">
            <div class="main-ctn-que change">How does Mobile Massage vet the therapists in its network?</div>
            <div class="main-ctn-ans">We’re very careful about the massage therapists we select to join the Mobile Massage network. We interview all therapists in person and make sure they are fully licensed and Insured in their state of practice. We accept only the highest quality therapists with a history of excellence in customer satisfaction. In most states the process to become a certified massage therapist (CMT) requires applicants to successfully pass background checks conducted by a state investigator, before being deemed able to safely work with the public. All Mobile Massages Therapists have passed these government sponsored certification measures. In order to become a CMT, a therapist must also complete a minimum of 500 hours of practical training, but some states require as much as 1,000 hours. All Mobile Massage massages therapists have the highest level of integrity and professionalism. In return, we expect all clients to reciprocate the same level of respect and conduct.</div>

Keep in mind, however, we cannot guarantee that the same therapist will be available at the time you request.</div>

If you feel more comfortable nude, you may undress completely and position our body under the sheet. Therapists are trained to properly drape your body to protea your modesty and theirs.</div>
        </div>
